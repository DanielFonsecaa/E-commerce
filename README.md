This project is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless browsing and shopping experience for mobile accessories. It features a dynamic front-end for users to explore products and a robust back-end for managing inventory. 
The application allows customers to browse, and add products to their cart while administrators can manage the product catalog effectively.

-- *Features*

If you need to see the endpoints of my backend using Swagger you can the documentation for it

[http://localhost:3000/api-docs/](http://localhost:3000/api-docs/)

Product Catalog Management:
Administrators can add, edit, and delete products, ensuring an accurate and up-to-date inventory of mobile accessories.

Search and Filtering:
Users can quickly search for specific accessories and filter products by categories such as brand, type, or price.

Responsive Design:
The application is fully responsive, providing a smooth and consistent user experience across all devices and screen sizes.

Dynamic Cart Management:
Customers can add products to their cart and view updates in real-time as they shop.

RESTful API Integration:
The front-end communicates with the back-end via a RESTful API for smooth data synchronization and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

#### Back-End

Node.js: Core runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution.

Express: Framework for building the RESTful API that powers the application.

Swagger: Used for API documentation and testing, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for efficient and scalable data storage.

Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, simplifying schema definition and data validation.

Crypto.js: Implements cryptographic functions for hashing and securing sensitive data.

JWT: Used for user authentication and secure session management.




#### Front-End

   Vite: Fast development build tool to bundle and serve the application.
   
   React.js: Front-end library for building dynamic and reusable UI components.
   
   JWT Decode: Decodes JSON Web Tokens to manage user sessions on the client-side.
   
   Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern designs.
